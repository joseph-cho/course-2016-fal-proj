Our datasets are the following:
* Bicycle collisions 
* Zip codes
* Waze
* Liquor stores 
* Crime Incident Report
* Property Assessment 2016

In this project we are aiming to create crime profiles for different areas. We classify crimes by money based (larceny and etc.) crimes, physical assaults and vandalism. We also want to look at the general danger a person in that area may face. To do that, we will look at both motor vehicle and bicycle accidents. We want to identify the rates at which these crimes/incidents occur within each zip code, and also how each area compares to each other.We also intend to complete the general picture by providing background on the property cost and the presence of liquor stores. When we are done manipulating the data, we hope to get an idea of what areas are more prone to certain kinds of unfortunate events. 

In order to get information about transportation related accidents, we will look at the Waze and Bicycle collisions datasets, and group the information by zip code. We will get a general breakdown of how much crime occurs in an area (and what types of crimes they are) from the Crime Incident Report. We want to see if these crimes are potentially related to the presence of liquor stores and the general “affluence” of the residents. We will judge the latter using the Property Assessment 2016 dataset, which gives property values for various properties in Boston.
