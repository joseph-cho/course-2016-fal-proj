For project 1, we chose five publicly datasets which are Crime reports, active food licensing, police station distribution, entertainment spots distribution and Liquor stores distribution. The question that is wish to be answered by this project is how citizens’ residential happiness are affected by the datasets we have. And we wish to solve this question by plugging in all the geographical coordinates of these datasets.

	      	mongod -- auth --dbpath “YOUR DB PATH”
