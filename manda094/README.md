For this project, the question I wanted to address was whether the factors of poor housing, food banks,
and children feeding programs, which are usually indicators of a low income location, led to 
a higher crime rate.  I combined the number of children feeding programs in Boston to the food banks
in Boston to see the correlation.   I also combined the 311 Service Calls dataset with the Building Code Enforcement Report
to see the comparison of Unsafe and Unstable Structures within certain parts of the city. I also used this to see
if the number of unsafe buildings was all within one general location. A new dataset was created out of this which was then used
to compare against the crime incident report to see the locations of unsafe buildings, assistance with food, in relation
to reported crimes.
