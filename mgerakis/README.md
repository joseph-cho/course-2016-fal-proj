# Data Sets
I chose to work with the following five data sets:
* [Boston Police Department FIO](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Boston-Police-Department-FIO/xmmk-i78r)
* [Boston Police District Stations](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Boston-Police-District-Stations/23yb-cufe)

# Project Narrative
Due to recent events, police descrimination against minorities has come into question. In 2010, the Boston Police Department commissioned a study to determine how officers were utilizing the Field Interrogation and Observation program in the city. More information about the article can be found [here](http://bpdnews.com/news/2014/10/8/boston-police-commissioner-announces-field-interrogation-and-observation-fio-study-results), but it was found that there were some racial disparities. The BPD has tried to address these concerns, and it is important to make sure that there are in fact changes being made. Using public data available, my project aims to find correlations between FIO and certain police districts, and then further map FIO events to discern if there is indeed still racial disparities. Public data can also be used to determine if certain officers are conducting more FIOs to icrease salary or overtime pay.
