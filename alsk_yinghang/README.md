# Assignment #1
## Project
The purpose of this project is to figure out which factors influence crime. With the information we produce, we can predict new potential hotspots for crimes and what measurements can be taken to limit the problem.

## Data Sets
* [Crime Incident Reports](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Incident-Reports-August-2015-To-Date-Source-/fqn4-4qap)
* [Streetlight Locations](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Facilities/Streetlight-Locations/7hu5-gg2y)
* [Police District Stations](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Public-Safety/Boston-Police-District-Stations/23yb-cufe)
* [Food Pantries](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Health/Food-Pantries/vjvb-2kg6)
* [Property Assessment](https://data.cityofboston.gov/Permitting/Property-Assessment-2016/i7w8-ure5)

## Transformations
Streetlights will be combined with crime to generate an overview of how many streetlights within a certain radius around a crime location.
Police Stations will also be combined with crime to figure out the distance from a crime to the closest police station.
Lastly, we've combined Property Assessments with crime to calculate the average property value in an area surrounding the crime.
